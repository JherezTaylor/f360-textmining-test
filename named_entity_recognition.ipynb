    "### Logic for identifying person names and occurrence frequencies from a given Chinese wikipedia page\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Names of persons' might occur in the same page by complete, incomplete, and alias representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: 'Donald Trump' and 'Trump'; and 'Ing-Wen Tsai', '蔡英文', '小英', '英文', '蔡博士', '蔡總統', '蔡女士', and '小英總統'.\n",

    "#### Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we improve the precision and recall by filtering 'nouns which are not the name of a person' and 'incorrect names of persons created by segmentation'?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we find synonyms? For instance, '蔡英文', '小英', '英文', '蔡博士', '蔡總統', '蔡女士', and '小英總統' are 'Ing-Wen Tsai'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we distinguish the names of persons from ambiguous results? For instance, 'Mr. Smith is a smith.' in which the second 'smith' is not the name of a person. Another example (in Chinese) is '蔡英文的英文很好', in which the first '蔡英文' is 'Ing-Wen Tsai' but the second '英文' is 'English' which is not the name of a person."
